\frametitle{Terminology}
%Spatial data types or geometric data types provide a fundamental abstraction for modeling the geometric structure of objects in space as well as their relationships, properties, and operations.
\begin{itemize}
  \item The data are seen as being a realization of a stochastic process, that is, of a set of random numbers each of which is associated with a spatial location.
 \item A spatial process in $d$ dimensions is denoted as:
\end{itemize}
\begin{equation*}
  \{Z(\bs): \bs \in \mathcal{D} \subset \mathbb{R}^d\}
  %\{Z(\boldsymbol{s}): \boldsymbol{s} \in \mathcal{D}\}
\end{equation*}
where
\begin{itemize}
  \item $Z$ is the attribute we observe (e.g. temperature, number of sudden infant deaths etc.)
  \item $\bs$ is the location where $Z$ is observed (e.g. coordinates such as latitude and longitude)
  \item $\mathcal{D}$ is the domain, and it is called the \emph{index set} = possible locations
\end{itemize}
\vspace{10pt}
\rule{\textwidth}{0.4pt}
\tiny{Symbols are as follows: $\{\}$ a set (a collection of elements); $\in$ element of or belongs to; $\subset$ subset of; $\mathbb{R}$ real numbers set}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Type of spatial data}
\cite{Cressie1993} distinguishes three types of spatial data, based on the nature of the spatial domain $\mathcal{D}$:
\begin{itemize}
 \item \vfill \alert{Areal data (also known as lattice data)}: $\mathcal{D}$ is fixed (of regular or irregular shape) and partitioned into a finite number of areal units (e.g. census tract, pixels) with well-defined boundaries. %$Z(\boldsymbol{s}_i)$ is a random variable at each location (area) $\boldsymbol{s}_i$, for $i=1,\dots,N$.

\item \vfill \alert{Geostatistical (or point-referenced) data}: $\mathcal{D}$ is a continuous fixed set. By continuous we mean that $Z(\bs)$ can be observed everywhere within $\mathcal{D}$. By fixed we mean that the points in $\mathcal{D}$ are non-stochastic. %$Z(\boldsymbol{s})$ is a random variable at a selected location $\boldsymbol{s}$, where $\boldsymbol{s}$ varies continuously over $\mathcal{D}$.

\item \vfill \alert{Point pattern data}: $\mathcal{D}$ is itself random. Its index set gives the locations of random \emph{events} that are the spatial point pattern. %$Z(\boldsymbol{s})$ may be equal to 1 $\forall \boldsymbol{s} \in \mathcal{D}$ indicating occurrence of the event, or random, giving some additional information (that is, these events can have attributes, given in terms of \emph{marks}).
\end{itemize}

%Lattice data can be either irregularly aligned or gridded, and occur in the form of aggregated observation over areas.

\footnotesize{
\begin{itemize}
\item This figure is an example of a \emph{\textbf{choropleth map}}, which uses shades of color (or grey scale) to classify the values of the variable that we are mapping into classes.
%\item From the choropleth map we know which areas are adjacent which other areas. The relationship between areal units is characterized in terms of \alert{adjacency}.
%\item Areal data differs from point data, which consists of measurements from a known set of geo-spatial points.
\item The ``sites'' $\boldsymbol{s} \in \mathcal{D}$ in this case are actually the polygons themselves. %which can be denoted not by $\boldsymbol{s}_i$ but by $B_i, i = 1,\dots, N$ to avoid confusion between points $\boldsymbol{s}_i$ and regions $B_i$.

%It wasn’t just the disease. But he also mapped out roads, property boundaries, and water lines.
%When he added these features to a map, something interesting happened. He noticed that cholera cases were only along one water line. This was a breakthrough that connected geography to public health safety.
The question of primary interest is whether, and if so where and when, statistically unusual local concentrations of cases occur.}

%\subsection{Spatial data in R}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Spatial data in R: Vectors}
The are two fundamental distinctions: spatial \alert{vector} data and \alert{raster}.
\begin{itemize}
  \item \vfill \alert{Vector} represents the world using \alert{points}, \alert{lines} and \alert{polygons} or combinations of those, where:
      \begin{itemize}
      \item \vfill \emph{Point}, is a single point location, such as a geocoded address or a temperature sensor or the location of a bus stop;
      \item \vfill \emph{Line}, is a set of ordered points, connected by straight line segments such as route travel or connections between locations;
      \item \vfill \emph{Polygon}, is an area, marked by one or more enclosing lines such as local authority districts or census tracts.
      \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
Simple features, \texttt{sf} package \citep{Pebesma2018} support 17 geometry types. Of these, 7 are used in the vast majority of geographic research:

\end{figure}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Spatial data in R: Rasters}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \vfill \alert{Raster}: divides the surface into cells (also called pixels) of constant size. Each cell has a value associated with it, which might be numeric or categorical. 
   \begin{itemize}
   \item \vfill Raster maps usually represent continuous phenomena such as elevation, temperature, population density.
   \item \vfill Raster data are the basis of images used in web-mapping and have been a source of data since the origins of aerial photography and satellite-based remote sensing devices.

\frametitle{Some R packages we will start to work with in week 6}
 \begin{footnotesize}
 \begin{itemize} \setlength\itemsep{\fill}
 \item  \texttt{sf}, which is a recently developed package for spatial vector data (points, lines, polygons etc.) and combines the functionality of three previous packages \texttt{sp}, \texttt{rgeos} and \texttt{rgdal}. It refers to a formal standard that describes how objects in the real world can be represented in computers, with emphasis on the spatial geometry of these objects
 \item  \texttt{sp}, which precedes \texttt{sf}, and with the \texttt{rgdal} and \texttt{rgeos} package, it creates a powerful tool to works with spatial data. Many R packages still depends on the \texttt{sp} package
 \item \texttt{spdep}, which includes functions and tests for evaluating spatial patterns and autocorrelation
 \item  \texttt{tidyverse}, which is a coherent system of packages for data manipulation, exploration and visualization
 \item \texttt{ggplot2}, \texttt{tmap} and \texttt{mapview} for visualization and maps
 \item \texttt{SpatialEpi}, which provides methods for spatial epidemiology
 \end{itemize}
 \end{footnotesize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]

Many spatial R packages still depends on the \texttt{sp}, thus it is important to know how to convert \texttt{sp} to and from \texttt{sf} objects

{\scriptsize
\begin{verbatim}
library(spData); library(sf); library(tidyverse)

# world is a sf object containing a world map data
# from Natural Earth with a few variables from World Bank
world <- st_read(system.file("shapes/world.gpkg", package="spData"))
plot(world["pop"])                # plot world population

world_sp <- as(world, "Spatial")  # from sf to sp object
class(world_sp)                   # "SpatialPolygonsDataFrame"

world_sf <- st_as_sf(world_sp)    # from sp to sf object
class(world_sf)                   # "sf"  "data.frame"

\end{verbatim}
}
\vspace{-15pt}
\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[scale=0.35]{World_pop.jpeg}
\end{figure}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]
\texttt{sf} works well with the \texttt{tidyverse} collection of R packages.\\
\vspace{5pt}
For example, functions can be combined using the pipe operator \scriptsize{$\%>\%$} \normalsize{(given that both packages are loaded)}
{\scriptsize
\begin{verbatim}
# Select and plot information for a single attribute
world %>% select(lifeExp) %>% plot()

\end{verbatim}
}
\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[scale=0.60]{LifeExp.jpeg}
\end{figure}
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}[fragile]
\texttt{sf} object includes spatial metadata like the coordinate reference
system (CRS), which are stored in a list column.\\
\vspace{5pt}
We can extract and plot only the geometry with the function $st\_geometry()$
{\scriptsize
\begin{verbatim}
# Extract geometry
worlg_geo <- st_geometry(world)

# Extract and plot out only the geometries
world %>% st_geometry() %>% plot()

\end{verbatim}
