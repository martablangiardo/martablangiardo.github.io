`r vspace("10px")`

The generalised linear predictor for the average of the outcome $\mu_{it}$:

- Flexible structure - adapt to data availability:
             
$\Rightarrow$ Can include controls and non linearity in time trends.
           
- Account for dependencies in space / across units: 
             
$\Rightarrow$ $\bm{\gamma}$ can be modelled as exchangeable or spatially structured (neighborhood or distance based); 
           
- $\delta_1$ $(\delta_0)$ identifies the causal effect of the intervention. Additional time dependent causal effects can be obtained through $\lambda_t$ if appropriate.
           
$$E[y_{it}] = h(\mu_{it}) = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 w_i + \delta_0 z_{t} + \delta_1 w_i z_t+ \sum_{k=1}^K \beta_k X_{itk} + \gamma_i + \boldsymbol{\lambda}_t$$

- Can include relatively vague information in the priors, which can still help regularise the inference
           
$\rightarrow$ Avoid inconsistent estimates because of small numbers/separation
           
$\rightarrow$ Use Penalised Complexity (PC) priors

`r vspace("20px")`

- Direct characterisation of full uncertainty in all model parameters
           
$\rightarrow$ Can then rescale (e.g. from regression coefficients to original scores etc) and still obtain samples from the full posterior distributions
           
$\rightarrow$ Particularly helpful for generalised linear models and for obtaining functions of original parameters
           
$\rightarrow$ Can aggregate at any space-time resolution

# Interpretation
  
`r vspace("50px")`

`r include_fig("Effects_inc.png")`

- $\delta_0$: potential discontinuity in controls before-after intervention.

`r vspace("20px")`

- $\delta_1$: difference of differences before - after intervention between exposed and controls (at intervention time).

--
  
`r vspace("50px")`

- Rich output means that we can easily look at differences for specific times before-after.

`r vspace("20px")`

- Potential flexibility of the model traded-off with the difficulty in interpretation if a more flexible time trend is considered.

- After the Second World War, the UK faced severe labour shortages. To make up for this they encouraged people from British Colonies to move to the UK, with the promise of jobs, a better standard of living, and British Citizenship 
    
- Between 1948 and 1970, nearly half a million people moved from the Caribbean to Britain. These individuals became known as the **Windrush Generation**, after the ship which carried some of the first migrants
    
- The Immigration Act of 1971 meant that only commonwealth citizens who arrived before 1971 were allowed the right to stay in the UK
    
- However, in 2010 the British Home Office destroyed all migration records from the 1950s and 1960s
  
- This meant that many people who came to Britain as part of the Windrush Generation, and many of their children, no longer had evidence of their British Citizenship

- evidence of greater psychological distress in people from Black Caribbean backgrounds

- increase in mental distress between the two periods with post media coverage having a bigger effect across all ethnic groups


<!-- we found evidence of greater psychological distress in people from Black Caribbean backgrounds than White participants after implementation of the Immigration Act 2014 (MD 0·67, 95% CrI 0·06 to 1·28). This effect persisted for several years, shown by the absence of difference over time since implementation of the Immigration Act 2014. We also found evidence that the Black Caribbean group had a further increase in psychological distress relative to White participants after the Windrush scandal media coverage commenced in 2017 (MD 1·28, 95% CrI 0·34 to 2·21).

Apart from Black Caribbean (where the immediate effect of the policy is strong), there's an increase in mental distress between the two periods and post media seems to have a bigger effect across all ethnic groups

included ethnic group, the exposure period, all aforementioned confounders, a linear fixed effect for time (by year), a linear fixed effect for time since the start of each exposure period (by year), random effects to model residual temporal confounding (by year), and residual spatial confounding (by local authority area). These random effects accounted for variation not captured by our measured fixed effects. We specified weakly informative priors for all model parameters; these allow one to stabilise the inference while not imposing overbearing restrictions on the parameters’ values. We fitted the interrupted time series model using integrated nested Laplace approximations (INLA) through the R-INLA package -->

# Discussion

- Flexible robust framework which can be adapted to a range of questions at individual and aggregated level

`r vspace("30px")`

- It naturally allows the construction of additional quantities of interest with their associated uncertainty

$\rightarrow$ Immediate and sustained effect can be obtained 

`r vspace("30px")`

- Caveat: it cannot always be framed in a traditional causality perspective, but it allows to evaluate the effect of intervention in a regression-type model
