Welcome to the course "Geospatial Analytics using R and R-INLA".

 This short course will provide a comprehensive introduction to concepts, methods, and R tools for geospatial data analytics, which involves collecting, exploring, modelling, and visualising data that exhibit dependencies in space and/or time. Specific focus will be given to Bayesian inference through the Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA) approach. 
 
We will first go through the basics of Bayesian inference and will then learn how to model hierarchical structures. We will also introduce elements for geocomputation with R. Then we will move to the core of the course, by focusing on area level data and presenting how to model spatially structured random effects through conditional autoregressive specifications.  Following that, we will extend the approach to include temporal dependency and touch briefly on spatio-temporal interactions. Moving on to geostatistical data we will introduce the stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) approach, used for spatial modelling on a continuous field. We will then extend this to deal with spatio-temporal data. Finally, we will describe how to use R-INLA for more advanced problems in the spatio-temporal realm, for instance how to deal with misaligned data. 

Throughout the course there will be practical examples from epidemiology, public health, environmental and social sciences fields. The course will be delivered through a combination of lectures and computer-based practical sessions.

It would be beneficial if you could bring your laptop having installed the latest R (version 4.3.1) and the following packages:

- INLA (instructions at https://www.r-inla.org/download-install)

- install packages using:

install.packages("remotes")

pkg_list = c("sf", "spData", "terra", "stars", "sp", "spdep", "geoR", "fields", "gstat", "tmap", "ggplot2", "RColorBrewer", "mapview", "leaflet", "cowplot", "viridis", "patchwork", "knitr", "kableExtra", "tidyverse", "mvtsplot", "GGally", "corrr", "SpatialEpi", "spTimer", "units", "stringr" ,"inlabru", "fmesher", "splancs")

remotes::install_cran(pkg_list)

- install package fingertipsR as follows:

options(repos = c(
  ropensci = 'https://ropensci.r-universe.dev',
  CRAN = 'https://cloud.r-project.org'))

install.packages('fingertipsR')

- install Rtools from https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/

- install the latest version of Rstudio at https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/
